# Lumina-Core

Smart contracts for blockchain-based vesting vault and token streaming infrastructure with governance, compliance, and cross-chain capabilities on Stellar Soroban.

## 🚀 Key Features
* **Defensive Governance:** Shifting control to a collaborative ecosystem with challenge periods and veto powers for beneficiaries.
* **Auto-Stake Integration:** Synchronous cross-contract staking that generates yield for beneficiaries without transferring vault assets.
* **Dead-Man's Switch (Inheritance):** Integrated inactivity timer allows primary owners to nominate backups to claim vault ownership in key-loss events.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Language/Framework:** Rust / Soroban WASM
* **Key Dependencies:** `soroban-sdk`
